# Introduction
The Segment Integration SDK is a framework designed to help developers build reliable integrations with Segment. Integrations built using this tool are consumers of Segment events, contrary to upstream producers of Segment events. To learn how to send events to Segment, visit our [docs](https://segment.com/docs/sources/).

# Getting Started
Documentation and a quick start guide can be found [here](https://segment.gitbook.io/project/-LZ62ZxaRM7vxXe_MLAt/).

# Examples
You can find a simple example of an integration in the `/examples` directory.
